## Description

I was to create a small quiz app that met the following criteria: 

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score

I had a very difficult time with this project. I don't really understand javascript at this point in the course. I spent too much time on this.

## Technology Stack 
HTML, CSS, Javascript

## Usage
 A 10 question quiz to pass time
